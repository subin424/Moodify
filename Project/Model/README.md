# 모델 학습 및 평가를 기록한 파일

Some weights of ElectraForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at monologg/koelectra-base-v3-generator and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
